In the data folder there are three files: .DS_store, .gitkeep, and activity 9.R.

.gitkeep is the default file put in my github to keep track of folders
.DS_Store is a hidden file by mac
activity 9.R is an R script

The .DS_Store file store information about a folder's attributes including visual information.
The activity 9.R file store all of the code from activity 9 of STAT 184, where we looked at 3 different datasets and created data visualizations about each of them.

The purpose of this directory is just to help you understand all of the files that are stored in the data folder.
